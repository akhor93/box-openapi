description: |-
  Creates a request to download multiple files and folders as a single `zip`
  archive file. This API does not return the archive but instead performs all
  the checks to ensure that the user has access to all the items, and then
  returns a `download_url` and a `status_url` that can be used to download the
  archive.

  The limit for an archive is either 32GB or 10,000 files, whichever
  limitation is met first.
