description: |-
  Creates a request to download multiple files and folders as a single `zip`
  archive file. This API does not return the archive but instead performs all
  the checks to ensure that the user has access to all the items, and then
  returns a `download_url` and a `status_url` that can be used to download the
  archive.

  The limit for an archive is either 32GB or 10,000 files, whichever
  limitation is met first.

      If the `zip` archive is ready to be downloaded, the API will return a
      response that will include a `download_url`, a `status_url`, as well as
      any conflicts that might have occurred when creating the request.

      Returns an error if some of the parameters are missing or
      not valid.

      * `bad_request` - the request body is missing, or both the list of files
      and folders are empty. Additionally, the root folder with ID `0` can not
      be added to an archive.
      * `zip_download_file_count_exceeded_limit` - the requested files and
      folders would result in an archive with more than 10,000 files. The
      request will have to be split into multiple requests to reduce the number
      of files per archive.
      * `zip_download_pre_compressed_bytes_exceeded_limit` - the requested files
      and folders would result in an archive with more than 32GB of content. The
      request will have to be split into multiple requests to reduce the size of
      the archive.
